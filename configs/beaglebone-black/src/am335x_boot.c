 * Name: am335x_memory_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   All AM335X architectures must provide the following entry point.  This
 *   entry point is called early in the initialization before memory has
 *   been configured.  This board-specific function is responsible for
 *   configuring any on-board memories.
 *
 *   Logic in am335x_memory_initialize must be careful to avoid using any
 *   global variables because those will be uninitialized at the time this
 *   function is called.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
